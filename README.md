# 💫☁️ 🌸 My Digital Diary 🌸☁️ 💫

Welcome to my digital diary! I’m a high school junior excited about AI. This is where I’ll be documenting my learning journey! 

## My goals
1. Understand the “Why” - To be honest, AI kind of feels like a black box. It’s one thing to build and train a model in pytorch, but what is *actually* going on inside the model and being learned? I really want to dig deeper and understand the most fundamental mechanics of AI, and that starts with linear algebra.

2. Experiment with Applications - I want to learn about and experiment with new models and tools. Some things I’m interested in exploring: world models, diffusion models, AI interpretability & explainability, de-biasing AI & making it more fair, applying AI to medical imaging

3. Document everything - Journaling my progress helps me organize my thoughts and solidify my understanding. It can also help me see and look back on my progress, and hopefully, it can give others a bit of motivation to start their own learning journeys.
